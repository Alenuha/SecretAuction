# SecretAuction
A script for a simple Secret Auction, where the bidder (and their bid) is announced after all the bids are submitted

Note:
clear() The console function is used:
clear() method clears the console if the console allows it. 
A graphical console, like those running on browsers, will allow it; 
a console displaying on the terminal, like the one running on Node, will not support it, and will have no effect (and no error).
